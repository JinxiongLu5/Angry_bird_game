## Challenges

1. ...
2. ...

## Actions
1. Jinxiong Lu is going to implement a Speedboost Bird class and Explosive Bird class based on the Bird base class. Also implementing a ScoreBoard class that handles user interactions for inputting nicknames, uploading and retrieving scores, and displaying level scores. It manages both local score data and online score synchronization.

2. Qingyun Guo is going to implement a Vertical Movement Bird class and Split Bird class based on the Bird base class.
3. Nelly Nie is going to implement a Trajectory class based on the Bird base class.
4. Lujie Ban is going to use implement Bigger Bird class based on the Bird base class.

2. ...

## Actions
1. Jinxiong Lu is going to implement a ScoreManager class that handles the game's scoring system, including tracking and updating the score and displaying game-related statistics such as the number of throwables left, enemies left, and the current level. It also manages the display of the game's result (win/lose).
